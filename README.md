# LinearRegression-implementation-
### Here i have implemented linear regression in one varibale from scratch . I have used the Boston_Housing dataset provided in sklearn package . I have made my own linear regression model . I am fitting the training data using my function , then predicting the target . After this , i am using the inbuilt Linear Regression algorithm provided in sklearn and verifying the results for a particular split , the results are similar . 
### Here , i have found values of m , y in my fit() using partial derivative of the cost function wrt m and wrt c .
